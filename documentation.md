## Background: 
### The current system in place for renting IT equipment is very manual and is all reliant on the IT department inputting data and     checking dates, most of these requests come via email but they can be verbal communication in person or over the phone so it leaves all responsibility onto the IT department and there is room for human error. With a new system we could have users request their own equipment and have traceable confirmations and a reliable audit trail. The system is very manually and heavily relies on the IT department to do a lot of the work and take all the responsibility. Currently the system operates off SharePoint and is manually entered into the calendar, communication can be via email, telephone or face to face conversation between the customer and IT department.<p>

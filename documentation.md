## Background: 
### The current system in place for renting IT equipment is very manual and is all reliant on the IT department inputting data and checking dates, most of these requests come via email but they can be verbal communication in person or over the phone so it leaves all responsibility onto the IT department and there is room for human error. With a new system we could have users request their own equipment and have traceable confirmations and a reliable audit trail. The system is very manually and heavily relies on the IT department to do a lot of the work and take all the responsibility. Currently the system operates off SharePoint and is manually entered into the calendar, communication can be via email, telephone or face to face conversation between the customer and IT department.
## Wireframes: 
### As part of the assignment I created some low fidelity wireframes that I used as a plan to created my website. These dont match exactly to the final product as I found some challenges and issues with accessibility. I intended for my website to have 4 pages with one containing a tab, but in my final product I added another page where the customer could view previous requests which also contained a tab.
## Desktop Wireframes
### This is my intended landing/home page.

### This is the request page.

### This is the inventory page for the IT department to view a calendar of requests.

### This is the second tab in the inventory page which is a table of requests.

### This is the contact page for customers to reach the IT department with any issues.

### I also went one step further and created a prototype of my website wireframes in Figma.

## Colour Choices: 
### I conversed with my IT department on what colour scheme would fit with the company and found NETSCC have a blue theme. I tried to keep the website simple but modern and used a very small range of colours including blue, white and black and a relevant picture to modernise the look.
## Accessibility:
### My original design for the landing page was writing on a picture but I realised this isn't great for users who need visual aid so I had to change this in my final design.
## GDPR & Distance Selling: 
### My company have a whole range of GDPR and Distance Selling rules and regulations they need to abide by which I read into. However I some of it wasn't relevant for my website as it will onl be accessible by internal users so I researched more online and came up with my own guidance for the customer and attached this onto the landing page.
